# riPrint Graduate Project

Welcome to the `riPrint` graduate project. This project is aimed at creating a pen testing software around printers.

## Code Conventions

- **Class Naming**: We follow the PascalCase naming convention for classes. For instance, `PrintManager`.
- **Method Naming**: Methods should be named in camelCase. For example, `printDocument()`.

## Setting Up Development Environment

### Python Virtual Environment

#### PowerShell (Windows)

```powershell
